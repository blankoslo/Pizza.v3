                        Once upon a time, in a land where disco balls still reigned supreme, there strutted a human
                        tornado of coolness named Max Chillington. Legend has it that Max could make ice cubes shiver in
                        envy just by winking. <br /> <br />
                        His hair, a perfectly coiffed monument to follicular fortitude, once caused a gust of wind to
                        bow in admiration.
